# Tools I used
For this job several tools were used:
- **SQL:** basis of my analysis broject, awesome for creating database and querying tables;
- **PostgreSQL:** chosen database management system, is one of the most populat DBM systems, quite easy to set up and work with;
- **VS Code:** is good for database management and SQL queries writing, also is more lightweight than Visual Studio, and does the job well;
- **Git & GitHub:** for version control, comitting and sharing my project to GitHub;
